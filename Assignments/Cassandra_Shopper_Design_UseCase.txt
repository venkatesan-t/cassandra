1.Ideally How many Cassandra nodes(minimum) you should have in your cluster to make sure it is highly available?
Three nodes are required in Cassandra cluster to make the cluster highly available
2.What will be the replication factor and why?
We need replication factor as three for high data availability
3.What will be consistency levels for both Read and Write? Provide explanation whichever level you choose.
We choose consistency level of QUORUM, to get the latest data. If we choose ALL, the reads or writes will fail, if one of the node is down.
4.If price and inventory are changing frequently what will be your ideal approach to handle them?
We can add EFFECTIVE_FROM column in the table to store the date the price and inventory is effective from. The EFFECTIVE_FROM column should be part of the composite primary key.
If the price or inventory changes we add a new row with the day's date in EFFECTIVE_FROM. The price and inventory is valid till the next EFFECTIVE_FROM for the product.
5.If you are getting frequent updates,what should be your strategy or assumption while designing schema?
If are getting frequent updates, the database design should support temporal data.
We achieve temporal behaviour using the EFFECTIVE_FROM column.
