1.To ensure high availability we create 2 datacentres with replication factor at least 2.
Setup the cluster with replication factor as 2
2.Use an appropriate Snitch protocol to support the multi-data centercluster.
Using GossipPropertyFileSnitch
3.Use an appropriate partitioner to enable faster read operation and uniform data distribution.
Using Murmur3Partition
4.Ensure the replication factor can be met even if a number of healthy nodes is lesser than the replication factor. Hint: Use hinted handoff.
Using hinted handoff to enable coordinator node to record requests to nodes which are down
5.Device a mechanism to test that replication factor is eventually met after a dead node is made up again.
6.Ensure high level of read and write availability
We can query and write data with read and write consistency of QUORUM
7.The use case doesnâ€™t require to deal with most recent data. So, consistency level can be kept low for read and write.
We can query and write data with read and write consistency of QUORUM
8.Display the cluster status in a command line.Hint:Use nodetool command.
nodetool status
